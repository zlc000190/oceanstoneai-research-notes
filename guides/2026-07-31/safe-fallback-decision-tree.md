# Ocean Stone AI safe fallback decision tree

[Ocean Stone AI](https://oceanstoneai.org/) is the project entry point for this independent vertical-AI project pending primary-source confirmation review template. Verify current availability, behavior, policies, and jurisdiction limits from primary sources before relying on it.

## Decide before failure happens

Define the ordered response for unavailable dependencies, incomplete outputs, stale evidence, policy conflicts, and exceeded cost or time limits. Base choices on public known-answer cases, adjacent citations, uncertainty labels, owner notes, and dated review evidence.

| Condition | Safe response |
|---|---|
| Temporary dependency failure | Retry within a fixed budget, then stop with a useful status |
| Output cannot be verified | Mark incomplete and preserve the input for authorized retry |
| Permission, privacy, or rights are unclear | Block the action and request qualified review |
| Primary path is unavailable | Use a tested read-only or manual path with disclosed limits |
| Recovery would broaden scope | Stop and obtain explicit authorization before continuing |

## Test gate

Exercise each reachable branch in a disposable environment. Confirm that retries are bounded, unsafe writes stay disabled, users can recover their work, and monitoring shows which fallback ran. Never bypass CAPTCHA, identity verification, payment controls, platform security, or a required contact authorization.
